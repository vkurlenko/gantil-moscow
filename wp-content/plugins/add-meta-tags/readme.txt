A metadata plugin that can optimize your web site for more efficient indexing and easier sharing of your content. [DEPRECATED]

== Description ==

_Add-Meta-Tags_ is a Free metadata plugin for the _WordPress Publishing Platform_ that can optimize your web site for more efficient indexing of your content by search engines and easier sharing on social networks. It achieves this by generating machine friendly information about your content, called <em>metadata</em>, according to widely used standard specifications.

**NOTICE:** THIS PLUGIN HAS BEEN **DEPRECATED**. IT IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED. IT IS NO LONGER TESTED WITH NEW WORDPRESS RELEASES. USING IT IN PRODUCTION IS NOT RECOMMENDED.

IT IS STRONGLY SUGGESTED TO MIGRATE TO OTHER MORE MODERN AND BETTER MAINTAINED PLUGINS.

IF YOU ARE STARTING A NEW BLOG, IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO SEARCH FOR OTHER PLUGINS IN ORDER TO AVOID THE INEVITABLE FUTURE MIGRATION.

REGARDING EXISTING USERS, AT THE TIME OF WRITING, THERE ARE NO MAJOR BUGS. PROVIDED THAT THE WORDPRESS API DOES NOT CHANGE SOON, YOU HAVE THE TIME TO EXPERIMENT WITH OTHER PLUGINS AND PLAN YOUR MIGRATION.

SUPPORT VOLUNTEERS IN THE WORDPRESS FORUMS SHOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLUGIN TO NEW USERS.

<blockquote>

<strong>Notice about the development status</strong>

<br /><br />

The current feature set of this plugin is already beyond what I need or use, so further development, enhancement and testing of it is no longer in my priorities. Moreover, since the release of version 2.11.0, <strong>I do not provide any support</strong> for it and <strong>I no longer recommend using it in production</strong>. Due to lack of free time, there are no plans to do any more work on it. If you continue using this plugin in <em>production</em>, you are on your own.

<br /><br />

Furthermore, please consider that Add-Meta-Tags was started many years ago. In many cases it does its job in an inefficient way and its design and implementation should now be considered <strong>outdated</strong>. Addressing the implementation flaws would require rewriting the plugin almost from scratch, which is out of the question, since there are already many excellent and modern plugins in the WordPress Plugin Repository that are actively maintained and fully supported.

<br /><br />

So, <strong>I highly recommend to start planning your migration to other plugins</strong> as soon as possible. Regarding data migration, you can find specific information about how Add-Meta-Tags stores its data and general information about how you could migrate that data to other plugins in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/add-meta-tags/other_notes/">Other Notes</a> section.

<br /><br />

Last, but not least, there are several strong indications that during the last months my plugins have been the target of spammers. Be cautious! I strongly suggest that you <strong>completely avoid</strong> any forks of this plugin or any third party downloads. Instead, <strong>I strongly encourage you to migrate to other plugins</strong>.

<br /><br />

Also, please note that Add-Meta-Tags is not for sale and that I'm not interested in any idea about it.

<br /><br />

Finally, please note that the available documentation on the wiki may contain outdated information in some parts about the customization of the plugin. Since the plugin is now deprecated, there are no plans to work on the documentation. Again, I highly recommend starting your experimentation with other more modern plugins.

== Other Notes ==

Add-Meta-Tags uses the WordPress API to store its data in [Custom Fields](https://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields). The following notes outline the types of data stored in each field.

Since the plugin has been *deprecated*, this information is provided in order to facilitate the *migration of your data to other plugins*. For more information, you can refer to the relevant [Data Storage](http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Data_Storage) page on the wiki.

= Post objects =

The data of the following post related _Custom Fields_ is stored in the `wp_postmeta` table of the database.

- `_amt_description` - the content's custom description (the `description` field is also read as a fallback for backwards compatibility).
- `_amt_keywords` - the content's custom keywords (the `keywords` field is also read as a fallback for backwards compatibility).
- `_amt_title` - the content's custom title.
- `_amt_news_keywords` - the content's custom news keywords.
- `_amt_full_metatags` - the content's full meta tag code.
- `_amt_image_url` - URL of an image that overrides all other content images (see Notes below).
- `_amt_content_locale` - contains a content locale that overrides the global locale setting.
- `_amt_express_review` - contains special notation of review related information.
- `_amt_referenced_list` - list of URLs of items referenced in the post.


= Term objects =

The data of the following term related _Custom Fields_ is stored in the `wp_termmeta` table of the database.

- `_amt_term_full_metatags` - contents of the full meta tags box.
- `_amt_term_image_url` - custom image URL field (see Notes below).


= User objects =

The data of the following user related _Custom Fields_ is stored in the `wp_usermeta` table of the database.

- `_amt_user_full_metatags` - contents of the full meta tags box.
- `_amt_user_image_url` - custom image URL field (see Notes below).


= Notes =

The fields that store information about images may contain:

- An integer (attachment ID)
- An image URL
- The special notation: `URL,WIDTHxHEIGHT`


= Contact Methods =

The contact methods are Custom Fields of user objects.

The data of the following user related _Custom Fields_ is stored in the `wp_usermeta` table of the database.

The extra contact methods added by Add-Meta-Tags are:

- `amt_facebook_author_profile_url` as _Facebook author profile URL (AMT)_
- `amt_googleplus_author_profile_url` as _Google+ author profile URL (AMT)_
- `amt_twitter_author_username` as _Twitter author username (AMT)_

The following contact methods were also used in older releases:

- `amt_facebook_publisher_profile_url` as _Facebook publisher profile URL (AMT)_
- `amt_googleplus_publisher_profile_url` as _Google+ publisher page URL (AMT)_
- `amt_twitter_publisher_username` as _Twitter publisher username (AMT)_


= Example data migration by renaming the custom fields in the database =

This is an example SQL query which can migrate data from a Custom Field used by Add-Meta-Tags to a Custom Field used by another plugin.

Please note that the following example is provided for *informational purposes and for advanced users only* who have knowledge about how to issue SQL statements directly at the MySQL shell. If it seems too advanced for you, then please consult a technical expert.

Also, please, *always keep a backup of your database* before making any changes to it from the MySQL shell.

<pre>
UPDATE wp_postmeta SET meta_key='_other_description' WHERE meta_key='_amt_description';
</pre>

The above SQL statement renames the `_amt_description` field of the `wp_postmeta` table to `_other_description`.
