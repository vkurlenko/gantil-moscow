Improved Include Page plugin allows you to include the content of a page in a template file or a post/page (via a shortcode) with several options.

== Description ==

Improved Include Page (IIP) uses the WordPress Shortcode API to include the content of any page inside any other page or post.

= Using a shortcode in a post/page: =

[include-page id="123"] OR [include-page id="/about/resume"]

= Using PHP in a template =

<?php echo iinclude_page(4, null, true); ?>

For more details and examples, see the Installation tab.

Improved Include Page is an enhanced version of the original Include Page developed by Brent Loertscher.

= Key Features =

* Page title can be displayed with optional HTML code
* Content can be displayed with different styles (full, teaser, custom 'more' link)
* WordPress filters are applied to both the content and the title
* Supports the WordPress Shortcode API

== Installation ==

1. Download Improved Include Page
2. Extract the zipped archive
3. Upload the file 'iinclude_page.php' to the 'wp-content/plugins' directory of your WordPress installation
4. Activate the plugin from your WordPress admin 'Plugins' page.
5. Include pages in your templates using 'iinclude_page' function or in your pages/posts using the shortcode syntax.

= How To Use =

Once installed, the plugin adds the function 'iinclude_page':

void **iinclude_page**(int post_id [,string params, boolean return = false])

The function takes three parameters:
1. the id of the page to include ('post_id')
2. an optional string ('params') which contains the display options
3. an optional boolean ('return') tells whether to return the content or display it on screen.

= Example 1: using Shortcode API in posts or pages =

You can include a page's content in a page/post using the syntax:

    [include-page id="123"]

or

    [include-page id="3" displayTitle="true" displayStyle="DT_TEASER_MORE" titleBefore="<h3>" titleAfter="</h3>"  more="continue&raquo;"]

= Example 2: basic usage in templates =

If you wish to include the content of page number '4' insert the following code into your template file (e.g. sidebar.php):

    <?php iinclude_page(4); ?>

or

    <?php echo iinclude_page(4, null, true); ?>

In order to avoid PHP errors if the plugin is disabled, you should use the function with the following syntax:

     <?php if( function_exists( 'iinclude_page' ) ) iinclude_page( 4 ); ?>

= Example 3: using optional parameters in templates =

You can also display the page title using the following code:

    <?php iinclude_page( 4, 'displayTitle=true&titleBefore=<h2 class="sidebar-header">' ); ?>
	
= Parameters =

The current version supports the following parameters:

<dl>
<dt>displayTitle (<em>boolean</em>)</dt>
<dd>toggle title display</dd>

<dt>titleBefore/titleAfter (<em>string</em>)</dt>

<dd>string to display before and after the title</dd>

<dt>displayStyle (<em>integer constant</em>)</dt>
<dd>one of the following:
<ul>
<li><code>DT_TEASER_MORE</code> - Teaser with 'more&' link (default)</li>
<li><code>DT_TEASER_ONLY</code> -Teaser only, without 'more' link</li>
<li><code>DT_FULL_CONTENT</code> - Full content including teaser</li>
<li><code>DT_FULL_CONTENT_NOTEASER</code> - Full content without teaser</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>more (string)</dt>
<dd>text to display for the 'more' link</dd>
</dl>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I include pages using custom fields? =

Yes, but there's an extra bit of code you need. To include a page, you now need to use this syntax:

echo do_shortcode( get_post_meta( get_the_id(), 'custom_field_key', true ) );

== Changelog ==

* Bumping WordPress requirement to 4.0.
* Updates to description, documentation and tags.
* PHP code formatting tweaks.
* Support and development transferred from Vito Tardia to Marios Alexandrou.

= 0.5.0 =
* Added the '#more-<id>' in the "read more" link href, to avoid going to the top of the post when clicking (by Matthieu Sarter),
* Added support for the WordPress '<--more [text]-->' tag, so that the more link text can be defined at the post level (it can still be overriden at the 'iinclude_page()/[include]' level) (by Matthieu Sarter).

  Note: if you use HTML code in the 'more' link use single quotes for the 'more' parameter, like this: 

  '[include-page id="mypage" more='<img src="my/image.gif" />']'
